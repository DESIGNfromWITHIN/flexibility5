ClientConfig is the by product of a workshop at MODXpo Europe 2012,
the "Developing Extras in MODX" one. See the session page at modxpo.eu
http://modxpo.eu/schedule/sessions/developing-extras-for-modx-hands-on
for more information and footage of the workshop.

ClientConfig gives your client a user-friendly interface for making site
wide changes, while you as the administrator set up the different options
available to the end-user.

Possible uses include:
- Regularly update a slogan or tag-line in header or footer
- Change call-to-action button colors based on the season
- Keep contact details updated in one central location
- Update the email-address a form sends notifications to.
